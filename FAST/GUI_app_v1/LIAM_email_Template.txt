Good day OppOwn,

I am reaching out to engage with you relating the LIAM(Luminate Identity and Access Management) setup for Client_name in use with DMS for Opp_number.

My intention is to provide visibility into the LIAM registry process to accelerate the Time to Value realization in general. For DMS, onboarding a customer onto LIAM is required to enable the following at minimum:

  *   Authentication/authorization for the DMS ingestion service API, which customers use to ingest their data into BY.
  *   Data Doctor UI for customers to visual and review their data quality and issues.

The ask here is to present this information to the appropriate party(usually the Technical POC or IT manager) at Client_name to gather the necessary data points and return them to us upon completion. As this process is technical in nature, we suggest leveraging the BY TAM assigned to Client_name as the technical BY POC as well as the TA assigned to the project for additional Support if necessary.

Attached is a download of the questionnaire that has been partially filled out to share. Further information about the questionnaire and the LIAM federations supported please see here <https://jda365.sharepoint.com/sites/O365-azureadtribe/SitePages/LIAM-Integration-Questionnaire.aspx?OR=3DTeams-HL&CT=3D1649948183831&params=3DeyJBcHBOYW1lIjoiVGVhbXMtRGVza3RvcCIsIkFwcFZlcnNpb24iOiIyOC8yMjAzMDcwMTYxMCJ9>.

Please let me know if I can assist in clarifying or answering any inquires you may have relating to this process.

Thank you,

Your_name
